Developed a modular turn-based RPG using Java and MVC, with clear separation between UI, logic, and data layers. Implemented combat mechanics, map navigation, and event-driven interactions using advanced OOP and design patterns. Designed the project with a full-stack mindset to allow future integration with modern front-end and backend services.
